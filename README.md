### Context:
This project was completed during week 7 of learning JavaScipt. This was the first implementation of TDD so it took me about 13-15 hrs to complete. 

### Contributors:
Asher Spurr: https://github.com/AsherSpurr

### Learning Goals:
- Contribute code to a partially constructed application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
### Wins + Challenges:
#### Wins:
I am pleased with my implementation of TDD and my test cases for each file. This was my first time writing tests and my first time using them to drive my development. 
#### Challenges:
The project comp was difficult to follow at times. However, I do think that makes it good practice for what I may encounter on the job.
